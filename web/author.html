                            Stephen Egert, born on March 27, 1994, is the writer of the Beauty and the Neo Brigade novellas on stephenegert.com and the developer of this website. He grew up in New York in a small town on Long Island called Syosset. 
                            As a small child, he loved fantasy books for kids, but stopped reading for a while due to his dislike of the books he was assigned to read in school, which, while well-written, just didn't appeal to him. He would later go back to reading fantasy and superhero novels after he finished college, his favorite author being Jennifer Estep. 
                            <br><br>
                            Stephen didn't think of being a writer until his early high school years when he would constantly watch DVDs of his favorite TV shows, The Simpsons and Futurama. While watching these, he would listen to the DVD commentaries where he'd hear the writers talk about how they write for characters and come up with stories while also telling funny anecdotes. 
                            Stephen eventually paid more attention to the credits to see who made his favorite shows. His main writing heroes were Al Jean, David X. Cohen, and James L. Brooks, all of whom were writers that valued a good story coming first while being so skilled at coming up with good jokes to fit the story they wanted to tell. He then began a hobby of writing, which he started by writing his own Simpsons and Futurama fan scripts, beginning his interest in writing for characters. 
                            Another of his heroes was Simpsons writer, John Swartzwelder, who wrote some of the funniest episodes with the most bizarre jokes. It was hearing stories the other Simpsons writers told about him that led to Stephen discovering Swartzwelder being a writer of comedy novels. This was one of the first times as a teenager that Stephen learned there were books that could appeal to him and eventually bought several of his books. 
                            Stephen was so surprised that someone he admired could write for both the media of television and novels. This made Stephen think that maybe he could write a book too some day.
                            <br><br>
                            One day, Stephen rewatched a Simpsons episode where Homer became a food critic, featuring a joke with Homer using an old typewriter where the letter E was broken and he has such a hard time writing a review. During the DVD commentary, the episode's writer, Al Jean, pointed out that E is the most commonly used letter in the English language. Jean then mentioned that someone wrote a novel without using the letter E, alluding to Gadsby by Ernest Vincent Wright and La Disparition by Georges Perec. 
                            Stephen thought this was a good idea and immediately got started writing his first novel, choosing to not use the letter E. Not long after, Stephen wrote another novel, this time, without the letter S. He enjoyed writing for his own original characters, but he wasn't happy with the stories he wrote as they were a little too joke heavy and weren't focused on character or story. Choosing to focus on a developed character driven story, Stephen scrapped both those novels and started on a new one, opting for a superhero romance story starring his character, Beauty. 
                            Stephen's love of animation and video games that feature depth and well-written characters, along with worlds of heroes and villains with super abilities, inspired him to write like he was writing a TV show that would appeal to kids and young adults. While Stephen has no plan of publishing his first two novels, he decided to reuse the idea of writing without the letter S. As he developed his novel, just as he enjoyed stories that featured well-written female characters, he found he enjoyed writing for female characters even more, expanding the roles of supporting characters, Tel-E and Pyra. 
                            These inspirations and ideas led to the creation of what Stephen hopes to be his first published novel, Beauty vs. the Boy of Many Beasts.
                            <br><br>
                            Stephen went to college at Stony Brook University while working part-time as a cashier at IKEA. He graduated with a Bachelor's in computer science. After college, he worked as a web application development intern at a software company, though he would later shift his focus from development to QA testing after his internship. While studying in college, he learned to use different programming languages, hoping to become versed in web development. While writing his novel, he realized he would need a way to market the book. He decided he would write five novellas that led up to his novel that would help introduce the characters, which he could put on a website. 
                            During his senior year, Stephen decided to teach himself HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create his this site and he's added new pages such as the quizzes and character pages with the character hosts and dialogue to make it like the characters were the ones running the site while providing some trivia behind his stories. While he originally conceived the site to only include his stories, he came up with the dialogue element for the characters after being inspired by video games with in-game dialogue, particular ones that would break the fourth wall. His favorite of these games in terms of dialogue is Kid Icarus: Uprising. With his programming and testing experience, Stephen has included additional functionality for his site while creating test cases for them as well.
                            <br><br>
                            Stephen's hobbies include reading fantasy and superhero books/comic books, watching TV, learning Spanish through translated songs, playing Chess, writing his stories, and working on this website.
