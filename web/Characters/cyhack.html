                                As a child, Cyhack had a gifted intellect that she inherited from her father, Dr. Mozetti. She often used her enhanced intelligence in a snarky way with other kids so she could make them feel stupid. That’s why she decided to not skip any grades in school, so she could act smarter than everyone else.
                                Her hobbies included building gadgets, hacking computers and video games, and blowing up dolls with her gadgets. She especially liked to blow things up. As she got older, she took interest in using the Internet to annoy people and show off her intelligence. Since she loved to act smarter than people, she was a target for bullies who hated her smartass attitude and apparent nerdy personality. 
                                While she often suffered for being smart, she was able to use her brains against the brawn through the Internet by creating many anonymous online accounts and email addresses to make fun of his bullies and scare them with threatening messages. She was always discouraged from lashing out at others, but she felt like taking the high road was for suckers. She took joy in getting back at her enemies through technology that she did this as a hobby, and even programmed many viruses to send to anyone just because she could and would mostly get away with it. 
                                After she got her powers, she would use them to freak people out by taking technology into her body. When not doing this, she would permanently replace parts of her body with technology to make her like a real cyborg, even though she didn't need to.
                                <br><br>
                                She became friends with Fourize after getting picked on by some of the same bullies he had. While Fourize would be irritated and frustrated afterwards, Cyhack told him a way to get back at them without any repercussions, which turned out to be her anonymous Internet accounts to attack the bullies. Cyhack and Fourize became fast friends and would work together on many school projects together. 
                                After studying with Fourize, he discovered his heat vision powers. Cyhack wanted to let him test his abilities on some firewood outside, but also brought out glass that she manipulated so heat passing through it could turn to ice. This gave her the idea to use the same process on Fourize’s glasses, giving him ice vision as well.
                                When Fourize decided to use his powers to take revenge on his bullies, Cyhack thought that was awesome in that a device she invented got a lot of people hurt. This gave her a sense of his intellect being superior because she got the better of people through something she built. Deep down, she’s wished to use her own gizmos to show people who the smarter person is, which is why she would often fuse them into her body. When Fourize got the idea to form a super villain team, she was told that she could use his full potential as a genius to cause trouble for people with her technology and show everyone how smart she is and how cool technology is.
                                <br><br>
                                As a member of the J Gang, Cyhack is the snarky, brainy, mischievous right hand girl of Fourize. Her personal nemesis is Nator because they’re both expert technicians, so Cyhack wants to prove that she’s way smarter and her technology is superior, which she can do if she wins a fight against him. She often mocks Nator for being all machine and not being able to add new tech to him, and claims to be the superior cyborg.
