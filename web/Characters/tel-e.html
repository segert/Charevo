                                Tel-E was born on the planet Knowlgia, a planet populated entirely by intelligent women with human characteristics along with a tail and different skin colors. As all Knowlgian girls are born, she was created through a cloning process and was raised by her mother who also had super powers. As a little girl, she always loved to learn new things while also acting upbeat and carefree in life. After staying out late to visit the library when she was fourteen, checking out the Charevo Journal, a starship from the Planet Draco flew over her while she was on her way home.
                                An alien hunter appeared and captured her. As she was kept on the ship from her home and loved ones, she, at first, felt threatened and vulnerable, and began to grow a hatred for men in the two years she was held captive. While she was feeling so negative, she felt optimistic that she could be free and go home. As she held on to her sanity, she eventually managed to escape and fight her kidnapper off, using her powers to fight, even though her people have always been peaceful. She eventually got his ship to crash in Minor City as it entered Earth's orbit.
                                <br><br>
                                When she tried to escape the ship, her captor caught her again, but Race saw them and interfered. He didn’t know of his super speed, and Tel-E admired Race’s bravery. They then teamed up to fight the alien bounty hunter. When they defeated him, he fled the planet in his ship, leaving Tel-E stranded. However, after she and Race took down her abductor together, Tel-E changed her attitude about men, and became Race’s best friend. She then grew a love for innocent life on Earth, after Race, a nice person from Earth, saved her. She’s always loved both Earth plants and animals and even became a vegetarian.
                                After the Neo Brigade was formed, she acts as the cheerful, understanding, and reasonable one of the group. Her arch enemy is Dinomight, because while she believes intellect is the most important power a person has, he thinks it’s better to be all muscle and not smart, which makes them both want to show the other one which one is truly superior in a battle of brain vs. brawn. Since she took the Charevo Journal when she was kidnapped, she currently has the book, and continues to add to it as she meets new people on her adventures. Her hobbies include, reading, growing plants, taking care of animals, and playing keyboard and wind instruments.
