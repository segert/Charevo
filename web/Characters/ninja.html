                                As a child, Ninja was more reserved and quiet than all the other kids, preferring to play alone during recess. Everyone else noticed him being very quiet and well behaved, never doing anything wrong. This made Ninja appear innocent and easy to be around because he hardly ever said anything to annoy anyone. Because people often took him lightly, they would never suspect him of ever doing anything wrong. While Ninja appeared innocent, he would use this as a cover for his true mischievous personality. He would often want to make tricks and pranks to fool with people whenever he can. Through his years of going through school, he chose to remain aloof with many of his sinister tricks, preferring to get people through the element of surprise. When things he did would happen, he kept his reputation as the quiet one, making him be unsuspected and giving everyone a confused impact because they don’t know what just happened. He relished every chance he could get to get away with things, but he would either never get caught or catch people off guard when saying something they don’t expect him to say.

                                As he got older, he would practice martial arts and further find his spiritual side. However, as he developed his athletic skills, he would only use them for evil by using his agility to get away with more tricks that no one would catch him do. His favorite thing would be to steal things before people know they’ve been robbed before he quickly returns them to mess with their minds. As he got better as a martial artist, he would soon develop his teleportation and invisibility powers. Once he got the ability to move from one place to another very quickly and also the ability to not be seen at all, he found he could get away with anything. He had this and his mischievous side as a secret from everyone else while also keeping with his spiritual side when alone, often meditating in his free time.
                                <br><br>
                                Once when he secretly played a trick on a kid, using his teleportation and invisibility, Fourize saw him and was interested in his powers. He then suggested he use his powers as a super villain and join the J Gang. Fourize said that if he became a villain, he could surprise more people and steal better stuff that he won’t have to return. Ninja thought this seemed promising for him and jumped at the opportunity.
                                As a member of the Gang, he acts as the quiet, eager, and patient member of the group. His arch enemy is Pyra because they are both the quiet ones of their teams and while he can dodge any attack as a strong defense, she is all dangerous and can hurt anyone while Ninja can evade her well.
