                                Bendy grew up with two older brothers, Buddy and Buzz where the three of them would always hang out together doing things like bike racing, skateboarding, and playing pranks. They would often dare each other to do ridiculous things. Together, they just loved doing such silly and stupid things where they would very rarely think of the consequences. They weren’t so much doing things that were harmful to others, but mostly things where they would hurt themselves. They have often done things like dare each other to imitate dangerous things one or more of them have seen on TV. While the three brothers had fun together, Bendy was the one who aspired to get into more danger. His brothers were also smarter than him, so he loved getting the chance to impress them with dangerous things to try and achieve physical talent.
                                As much as Bendy would have fun with these pranks and dares, he would often get hurt the most and would dream of having a body that could withstand anything. On the night Tel-E crashed her kidnapper's ship, they dared Bendy to go boogie boarding at night in the part of the bay on the edge of the city where there are a lot of electric eels. Bendy accepted and went out, but got some initial pain as he got stung by eels frequently. The ship crashed as some of the chemical gas that fueled the ship leaked into the water. The stinging of the eels combined with the contaminated water that got into his lungs when he fell off his board eventually caused his Charevo Gene to activate, giving him his powers. 
                                <br><br>
                                Bendy became ecstatic to show off his powers to his brothers as they would do things with him to see how much punishment he can take. While he'd get hurt, Bendy was still in perfect shape with his new rubber body. However, after his brothers left for college in Gloom City early, Bendy was all on his own and didn't have anyone to have fun with when playing with his powers. One day, as he was walking by himself, he saw a bank getting robbed by Cold Miner and the Chill-dren. Seeing them as villains, he tried to fight them off to see what his powers could really do. Bendy eagerly jumped in to stop them and beat the Chill-dren pretty well, all while having fun with it, but then got frozen by Cold Miner. He was then saved by Pyra who was later joined by Race and Tel-E and also Nator.
                                They formed a team when they met each other that day as Bendy tried to look cool in taking some credit for defeating Cold Miner, but would say he was kidding afterwards.
                                <br><br>
                                Bendy acts as the silly, energetic, daring, wise cracking, incompetent one of the group, being like a daredevil while also being a coward at times. 
                                He’s mostly afraid of vicious animals, and while he thinks he’s invincible since his rubber body can’t take much damage, he can still feel moderate pain, except when electricity hits him, which he is immune to. He loves danger, but he only loves it when he knows what can happen to him, and doesn't like being unaware of risks. His hobbies include playing guitar, playing sports, skateboarding, and attempting dangerous stunts. His arch enemy is Tammy Time because they’re both the jokesters of their teams, but she’s able to have more of him in more places and do more while Bendy can only have more of him in more places while doing less, which Bendy doesn’t like how better she is.
