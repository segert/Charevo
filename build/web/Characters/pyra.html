                                Beginning as a child, Pyra was always passive about many things and people that bothered her and would make a sarcastic remark about them when she’s with anyone. She would always just act like herself, which was nice, sarcastic, helpful, and witty. When with her friends, she’d notice them try to act different and change themselves to impress others, which she disliked. Though she felt angry inside from many things she disliked, she would hold a lot of this in, and she was never shy about letting people know what she was thinking and didn’t care what others thought of her, because she liked just being herself.
                                <br><br>
                                On the night the ship Tel-E was kept in crashed in Minor City, she was walking down the street, very close to where the crash happened. When it did, it hit cars, which blew up as part of her caught on fire. Since she possessed the Charevo Gene, she got her powers that allowed the fire to mix with her body and control dark fire. However, she still suffered from the burning somewhat as part of her long hair burned off and she received several burn scars on her face.
                                After discovering her powers, she ran to her friend’s house to show her and later showed it off to all her other friends. In doing so, she accidentally let out a small dark blaze that got on the little brother of her popular best friend, giving his arm severe burns from it as the dark flame engulfed his arm. Everyone panicked at that as Pyra worriedly ran to him to absorb the flame and all of the heat from it on the boy’s arm. 
                                She saved the boy from continued burning, but he and all her friends were afraid of what else she would do and her best friend told Pyra to leave. After hurting the boy, people became afraid of her, and she became shy when around others, choosing to remain alone out of fear of hurting people and becoming feared, even staying away from her parents so they wouldn't get hurt.
                                <br><br>
                                She later found Bendy fighting Cold Miner and the Chill-dren and saved him from being frozen and met Race, Tel-E, and Nator. They formed the Neo Brigade and they accepted her as a friend, and weren’t afraid of her because of her noble intentions. Because they were some of the few people who wouldn’t be afraid of her and thought of her as a friend, she felt like she knew where she belonged. After joining the Brigade, she felt comfortable around them all and was able to act normal by being witty and sarcastic when she wanted to. However, she still feels afraid of being feared by those who don’t know her well and don't have abilities that would protect them from her.
                                Because of this, she acts confident when with friends, and shy when with others. She always tries to act cautious with her fire, which may come from her body when she doesn’t intend for it, so she tries to keep her distance from other people so they don’t get hurt. 
                                By feeling timid around other people, she has trouble fighting villains when innocent lives are at stake and there’s a chance she might hurt one of them. However, when no innocent people are involved, she can fight villains however she wants. She also likes to release her fire at bad guys after having so much of it built up in her for so long.
                                <br><br>
                                She acts as the modest, shy, tough, sarcastic one of the group. Her arch enemy of the J Gang is Ninja because they are both quiet, but she is all dangerous and can hurt anyone while Ninja is more defensive and can dodge her fire very well.
                                Her hobbies include reading, and playing bass.
