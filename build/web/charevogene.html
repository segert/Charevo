                    <h2 class="characterheader">Overview:</h2>



                    <div class = "geneinfo" >

                        <p style = "margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">The Charevo Gene is a rare gene that gives a person the potential to develop superpowers. 
                            When someone with this gene comes into contact with a dose of radiation or any large quantity of a toxic chemical, experiences suffocation,
                            receives a large electric shock, or experiences a similar near-death experience, their gene is triggered and the person receives superpowers. 
                            The powers of someone with an active Charevo Gene are based on three elements that reflect the person's character. As a result, no two people can have the exact same 
                            combination of abilities. <br><br>

                            Only one in 32,700 people on Earth are born with the gene. Everyone else with the gene inherits the gene from a parent 
                            who has received his or her powers. If someoneâ€™s parent has an active Charevo Gene, the person will develop their own powers at a young age, usually 
                            right before becoming a teenager and will not require chemicals or shocks to trigger their powers. If the parent does not have powers at the time the 
                            person is born, it is unlikely that the person will have the Charevo Gene. However if both parents have an inactive gene, it is possible for all offspring 
                            of theirs to inherit the gene.</p>

                    </div>

                    <h2 class="characterheader">Charevo Trinity:</h2>


                    <div class = "geneinfo" >

                        <p style = "margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">A person's powers from the Charevo Gene are determined based on the three elements that make up their
                            Charevo Trinity. The three categories of Charevo Elements are Behavior, Mentality, and Identification. A person's Behavior Element is based on how the person
                            acts, the Mentality Element comes from how the person thinks (or what the person is like that no one can see), and the Identification Element is determined by
                            how other people see the person. <br><br>

                            Since the person's abilities are based on his or her character, the power from the Charevo Elements is affected by how he or she acts, thinks, and is seen.
                            If someone greatly displays any of their elements, their powers will be enhanced. Conversely, if the person deviates from one of their elements, their power is
                            weakened. However, an element not displayed and one displayed very well can cancel each other out, resulting in no change in power.</p>



                    </div>


                    <h2 class="characterheader">Charevo Emblem:</h2>


                    <div class = "geneinfo" >

                        <img id="emblem" src = "images/Emblems/beautyemblem.png" alt = "Beauty Emblem PlaceHolder" class = "char-image-emblem" width = 200 height =200 style = "left: 10%;">

                        <p style = "margin-top: 200px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">Whenever someone's Charevo Gene is activated, in addition to the abilities, a mark will be tattooed on his or her
                            hand. This mark is called the Charevo Emblem. It consists of three different images that represent the person's Charevo Elements. Whenever someone uses a lot of power
                            at once, the Charevo Emblem will glow. And in cases where their powers have been neutralized, the Charevo Emblem will fade.</p>


                    </div>

                    <h2 class="characterheader">Charevo Fairies:</h2>


                    <div class = "geneinfo">

                        <img id="behaviorfairy" src = "images/Fairies/beautyfictionfairy.png" alt = "Beauty Fiction Fairy PlaceHolder" class = "char-image-fairy" style = "" width = 200 height =200>
                        <img id="mentalityfairy" src = "images/Fairies/beautyimaginationfairy.png" alt = "Beauty Imagination Fairy PlaceHolder" class = "char-image-fairy" style = "left: 40%;" width = 200 height =200 >
                        <img id="identificationfairy" src = "images/Fairies/beautyfemininityfairy.png" alt = "Beauty Femininity Fairy PlaceHolder" class = "char-image-fairy" style = "left: 70%;" width = 200 height =200>

                        <p style = "margin-top: 200px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">As the Charevo Gene and its elements represent the one who possesses them, the gene is meant to be tied to the person
                            through their unique qualities. Through the source of the elements and their power, whenever the person faces their own kind of trouble, three creatures called the Charevo
                            Fairies will emerge from the person's Charevo Emblem. Like the Emblem, the Charevo Fairies each represent a person's Charevo Element. These fairies can float near the person 
                            and will provide him or her with guidance based on the element they represent. These fairies carry the appearance of half the element it represents (based on the symbol on 
                            Charevo Emblem) and half the person who has the element.<br><br>

                            There is an unknown source that the Charevo Elements powers come from. One part of the source represents good and the other part represents evil. The heroes have the source
                            of good that causes everyone's Charevo Fairies to give advice that will lead him or her to become more successful as a good person. However, the villains have Charevo Fairies
                            of their own that come from the source of evil. These fairies have the same appearance as the good ones, except they have an evil dark aura around them. Unlike the heroes' 
                            fairies, the ones of the villains will give them guidance to make them more evil. While the advice of the good fairies are often cryptic and dependent on interpretation, the
                            evil fairies are more explicit and forceful in what they tell the person. Unlike the good fairies, after the evil fairies speak, the villain will succumb to part of the dark influence
                            without having to give any thought to their Charevo Fairies' guidance.</p>
